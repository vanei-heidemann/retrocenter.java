 * The date the software was released. If no exact year is known but the decade can be determined,
 * then use (199x) if from the 1990's, (200x) if from the 2000's etc.
 * If no information is available, use (19xx) or (20xx) until a year can be determined.
 * If more complete date information is known, then this can be shown using the format YYYY-MM-DD.
 * <p>
 * Also note that 19xx-MM and 19xx-MM-DD are allowed when only month or month and day are known,
 * this can happen in things like magazines and other monthly publications where year is unknown.
 * Additionally, if the exact day in the month is not known, but the day can be narrowed down to part of the month,
 * then 19xx-MM-Dx is also acceptable.
